## Personal Project - Desktop Python Static Code Analyzer
### Given a python file the program provides metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index while also running against python linters such as Pylint

### Was used in a data science project to collect metrics on python files, GUI was created to assist and speed up the process. Originally the code linters were run in the command line using shell scripts. The GUI creates an easy way to collect data for those unfamilar with shell scripts. Easily able to analyze files with results from multiple packages while displaying the results visually.
